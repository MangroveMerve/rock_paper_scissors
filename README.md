TOP Rock Paper Scissors JS Project

I'm going to plan the project in this read me file and make an attempt at pseudo code. 

The program will re-create the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. If you don't know what that is you are clearly living under a rock and have other issues. 

 The program will take an input from a person (Rock, Paper or scissors) and match that against a randomly generated choice for the computer. Winner score will increase by 1. Highest score after 5 rounds is the overall winner. 

1. Create and link an external JS file and link this inside the script tags of index.html.

2. Get the computers choice and store it in the variable getComputerChoice. 

3. Get the humans input and store it in the variable getHumanChoice.
